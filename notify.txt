Subject: Your email account has been temporarily blocked 

Dear User,

Your email account has been temporarily blocked because an unusual
pattern of usage was detected (e.g. an unusually large number of
messages in a short time span or logins from multiple locations
in a short time span). This may mean that your password is no
longer secure and your account has been compromised. To avoid
potential misuse, we have temporarily blocked the account.

In order to have your email account unblocked please contact
the system administrator. It would also be wise to change your
password as soon as possible.

Passwords that follow the rules below are in general safer
than ones that do not:
- the password should be at least 8 or more characters
- the password should contain a mix of uppercase, lowercase,
  digits and punctuation.
- the password should not contain your username
- the password should not contain other information that may
  be easy to find, e.g. your date of birth or that of family
  members.

Passwords should not be sent in an email message or saved
in an unencrypted file.

Where possible you should configure the use of encryption
for reading and sending messages from your email software.

Yours sincerely
System Administrator
